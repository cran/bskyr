Description: Collect data from and make posts on 'Bluesky' Social
    via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Application Programming 
    Interface (API), as documented at <https://atproto.com/specs/xrpc>. This 
    further supports broader queries to the Authenticated Transfer (AT) Protocol
    <https://atproto.com/> which 'Bluesky' Social relies on. Data is returned in a
    tidy format and posts can be made using a simple interface.
